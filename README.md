# Using_Json_to_Save_in_Unity

====
You can use Json to save in Unity.

## Description
I explained how to save using Json files in Unity and how to nest them using a List.

## Usage
First, paste "SaveManager" into an empty Game Object.
Then we use the game's script to store the data we want to save in the variables we have prepared in the "SaveManager".
When everything is stored, execute "SaveManager.Instance.GameDataSending()".
When loading, after executing "SaveManager.Instance.GameDateReceiving()", the data in "SaveManager" is stored in the game's script.
